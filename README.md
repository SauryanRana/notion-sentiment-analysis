## ðŸš€ Overview

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Collect feedback** from multiple sources (e.g., Google Forms, Slack, Intercom, etc.)
2. **Analyze sentiment & categorize** each entry using an AI model (*Positive*, *Negative*, *Neutral*, or *Mixed*)
3. **Store all results in Notion** â€” creating one page per feedback entry with key details:
   - Name  
   - Feedback text  
   - Source  
   - Sentiment  
   - Category  

This turns raw feedback into actionable insights â€” allowing teams to review and prioritize feedback efficiently.
